### Continue unfinished work during coding phase 1 & 2

Since this is the final phase for GSoC, part of my work is to refine previous work
and get them merged before the end of coding phase 3.

[Implement meta-review scoring & ranking system](https://github.com/coala/community/pull/143)
has been pending for almost two months. It is now very close to be merged, said by
org admin. I also separated one part of logic and created another PR:
[Change meta-review models](https://github.com/coala/community/pull/166),
which has been merged. Once this gets done, I need to finish another pull request
regarding documentation, which was blocked by this PR.

There are also two large pull requests for coding phase 2 pending.
[Setup meta review in need](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/65)
this is close to be merged now.

[Setup GraphQL client](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/67)
is finally approved by mentor. Also close to be merged now.

### Work on coding phase 3

There is a lot of work to be done in the coding phase 3, most of them are small
ones. The good news is I could get more and faster reviews for small prs than
huge prs.

[.travis.yml: Let moban task not deploy](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/77): merged

[Increase test timeout threshold](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/79): merged

[.travis.yml: Enable keep-history](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/73): merged

[run-test.sh: Verify files exist](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/75): merged

[login-modal.jsx: Add exception for default api url](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/80): merged

[dashboard.jsx: Add environment REPOSITORIES](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/81) approved

[Add review filters functionality](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/83) pending review

### Conclusion

There is not too much left. I'll need to hurry up and ensure my project could finish
and succeed as expected.
