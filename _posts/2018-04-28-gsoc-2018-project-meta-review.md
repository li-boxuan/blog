This year I am going to participate [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/),
which is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development.

Let me briefly introduce myself. I am Boxuan Li, a junior undergraduate student at
[The University of Hong Kong](http://www.hku.hk) and major in Computer Science.
I love coding! I have heard Google Summer of Code several times before,
but I didn't get to know open source until early this year. I joined coala
community this March. I didn't plan to take part in GSoC until the deadline was close.
At that time, it comes to my mind: why not have a try? GSoC would definitely be a fruitful
experience. And now I am here! My application gets accepted. Hooray!

My project is [Meta-reivew](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5188493739819008)
under [coala](http://coala.io). The meta-review project is about building a meta-review system,
similar to a meta-moderation system, that can track emoji responses to review comments.
These responses are to be collected, processed and displayed on
[gh-board](https://github.com/coala/gh-board), which is a nice serverless kanban board.

This is a challenge for me as I don't have much experience with frontend development.
Luckily, I have helpful mentors and the friendly coala community. Hope everything goes well!
