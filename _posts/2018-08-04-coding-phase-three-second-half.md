The past two weeks were quite busy. Let me briefly cover what has
happened.

### Finish all the work left in coding phase 1 & 2

Finally, I got all my previous work done. The review process of coala is
extremely strict. All the following prs take more than a month to merge.
Each of them was updated more than 10 times after batches of reviews, if
I recall correctly.

- [Implement meta-review scoring & ranking system](https://github.com/coala/community/pull/143)
 
- [Setup meta review in need](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/65)
 
- [Setup GraphQL client](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/67)
 
- [Meta-review.rst: Add meta-review docs](https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5514)

I proudly closed my milestones for coding phase
[one](https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/15) and
[two](https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/16). From my
observation, very few students in coala have closed their milestones 1 & 2.

### Conclusion

GSoC takes 3 months, but it is actually far longer than that. When organization list was
released on March, my GSoC journey started. Both April (proposal submitted) and May (bonding
period) were quite busy, let alone the real coding period (June, July, August). I knew very little 
about open source development & communities, but now I am proud to say I am an open source
enthusiast. I learned a lot and enjoyed a lot. Thanks to Google, coala, John (admin) and all
my mentors. I did a serious javascript project, which I could not imagine before GSoC started -
I knew nothing about frontend development & javascript. Again, thanks to everyone in the community.
Hope my project will pass the final evaluation ;)
